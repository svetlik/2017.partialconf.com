        <p>Hey hello, we are Genadi, Svetlio, Svetlio and Vestimir. We are the team behind Partial, a new conference from Sofia, Bulgaria focused on the impact of functional technologies on the web.</p>

<p>Last year the four of us had the privilege of organizing <a href="http://euruko2016.org">EuRuKo</a> in Sofia, and we were overwhelmed by the positive response (Here&rsquo;s one <a href="https://blog.nine.ch/en/2016/11/10/euruko-conference-2016">example</a>). Over 700 people from around Europe joined us in Sofia for a weekend full of talks and parties and we were able to partner with companies like Toptal, Receipt Bank, Deliveroo and Fyber, who supported us along the way.</p>

<p>This year we decided to pursue a long lasting dream for us – to start a new conference about functional development on the web. There are not many events about the lambda in the Balkan region, and we believe that mixing diverse communities with different technical backgrounds is superb opportunity to exchange ideas.</p>

<p>Last year we learned, that organizing an event is not an easy task, especially when you are four people passionate about tech and not a large company with dedicated marketing team. For Partial we are starting humble with a limited number of seats and a cozy venue in the city center, that will provide the opportunity for everyone to meet, greet and explore the city together.</p>

<p>That is why we need your support. Here are some ways you can help us make the first edition of Partial a weekend to remember.</p>

<h2>1. Apply for a talk</h2>

<p>We are halfway through the Call for Speakers (the deadline is 16th of June). If you want to share your experience, or introduce your project do not hesitate to apply for a talk. You will be presenting in front of like-minded developers, eager to learn new stuff and we will cover your flight and hotel.</p>

<p>Also, Sofia is pretty great during the autumn.</p>

<p><br />

<h2>2. Send your team to Partial</h2>

<p>If your company uses functional technologies – we’ve got you covered with two days full of new stuff to learn and ideas to exchange. Aside from that we’ll be introducing more activities over June, like workshops and pre-events.</p>

<p>Learning new stuff together is a great way of bonding for development teams, so we’ll be doing our most to provide a sandbox for that at Partial.</p>

<h2>3. Become a partner</h2>

<p>Supporting Partial will give you the opportunity to present your company or product in front of a diverse crowd of professionals.</p>

<p>We expect around 150 developers from all around Europe, both experienced in functional programming and newcomers, who are curious to explore the new possibilities provided by these technologies.</p>

<p>If you want to partner with us in bringing the very first edition of Partial to life – view the available packages here, and be sure to get in touch with us.</p>
